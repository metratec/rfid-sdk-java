# RFID Reader Examples

This simple VS code project demonstrates the use of the Metratec rfid library.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

The compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

Please note: The metratec-rfid-reader-library-r4.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar file is referenced from the parent folder of the example.
